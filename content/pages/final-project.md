Project Description
-------------------

The project takes the place of what would have been the last three homework assignments for the course. You can work in groups of two or three. Pick one of the problems that we are learning about, and take it further—to numerical examples, to applications, to testing a solution algorithm, or certainly to computations (using any language). Submit a short proposal just before or just after Spring Break. The project is due at the end of the last class.
